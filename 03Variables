1) short hand method 

just initialize the value
a := 10
b := "golang"
c := 4.17
f := "Do you like my HAT"
 to print them fmt.Println("%v \n", a)
 
 similarly for  knwing the type we can print %T
 
 2) Var style
 
 var a int
 var b string
 var c float64
 
 by deafult the default values are given for the statements.
 a is 0, b nothing means null, etc
