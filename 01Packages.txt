1) Packages has to be imported as  FQDN 

import (

     "fmt"
     "folder1/folder2/packagefolder"
)

2) the first line of the files insdide the folder package has to be same as  Package name
ex
package packagefolder 

3) Package scope:  the functions inside the multiple files are available inside the same package.

4)  making non accessible function : to make a functionaccessible outside a package we need to declare it with first letter captial. If letter is small it cant be accessed outside a package.

ex: func reverse() // not accessible
    func Reverse() // accessible
